# ESP_CONTROLLER

ESP_CONTROLLER is a project designed to facilitate wireless communication between a master controller and multiple receiver modules using ESP8266 or ESP32 devices. This setup allows for seamless control and monitoring of various devices over a Wi-Fi network.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **Master_Controller/**: Contains the firmware code for the master ESP device, responsible for sending commands to the receivers.
- **Receiver/**: Contains the firmware code for the receiver ESP devices, which execute commands received from the master controller.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the ESP_CONTROLLER project, follow these steps:

1. **Software Requirements**:
   - Arduino IDE for firmware development.
   - ESP32 board support installed in the development environment.

2. **Setup Instructions**:
   - **Master Controller**:
     - Navigate to the `Master_Controller` directory.
     - Open the firmware code in your development environment.
     - Configure the wifi channel(line 6).
     - Upload the firmware to the master ESP device.
   - **Receiver Modules**:
     - Navigate to the `Receiver` directory.
     - Open the firmware code in your development environment.
     - Configure the same wifi channel as `Master_Controller`(line 7).
     - Upload the firmware to each receiver ESP device.
